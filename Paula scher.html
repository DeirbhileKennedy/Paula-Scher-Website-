            <h2 id="scher’s Life">Scher’s Life</h2>

            <p>The 6th October 1948, Virginia U.S. This is the birth date and place Scher herself was born. Growing up in Philadelphia and Washington D.C, she began studying Design at the Tyler School of Art in Philadelphia. She graduated from the school of art in 1970 earning herself Bachelor’s degree in Fine Art. From here she moved to New York where she would now consider her adopted hometown, this is where Scher kickstarted her career and made her mark in the design world. .</p>

            <p>After moving to New York, she was quickly hired by CBS records in the advertising and promotions department, however this was quickly short-lived and two years later she moved to CBS’s biggest competitors Atlantic Records as she wanted to go down a more creative route instead of working for promotional purposes. When Scher moved to Atlantic records she was designated as the Art director where she began to design her first album covers which allowed her creativity to grow. Working here gave Scher the experiences that generated a longstanding fascination for how design in managed within organisations and the power structures that determine how design gets commissioned and completed.</p>

            <blockquote><p>‘I am fascinated by organisations and the way people behave in power structures.’
            <cite>—Paula Scher</cite></p></blockquote>
            
            <p>One year on Scher came back to CBS to work in the cover department as an art director where she worked for a further 8 years before wanting to go off on her own. Creating over 150 album covers a year Scher created work for the most iconic such as designing covers for Eric Gale, the typographic ‘Best of Jazz’ series and Boston’s 6m-selling debut.</p>
            
            <p>After years of working on her own between 1979 and 1984, Scher and a former friend Terry Koppel a fellow Tyler graduate, both co-founded Koppel and Scher. Their work included packaging, book jackets, and advertising. When Koppel left the business after 7 years Paula Scher, in the worlds biggest and leading design company went on to become a partner at the New York office of Pentagram.</p>

            <h2 id="pentgram">Pentagram</h2>

            <h2 id="the-public-theatre">The Public Theatre</h2>

            <p>In 1994, Scher was asked to create a new identity and graphics for The Public Theatre. This was the turning point in identity designs. In a theatre Visual storytelling is the main focus before the curtain even goes up, therefore the logo and show posters of a theatre are the main things that affect how people view the theatre, however this is something that most audiences don’t think about. Scher wanted this to be an opportunity for people and audiences to come together and remember the theatre and not just the show</p>
            
            <h3>Where to start?</h3>

            <p>Scher wanted an identity that would raise public awareness and the attendance of the public theatre would over overall appeal to a diverse crowd. Her idea was to make it visible in New York, to be load and out there like the city itself. This was all down to the typography, the style of the posters which were pretty powerful at the beginning. Throughout this process she created an effective graphic language that reflected the city pf New York, with its street typography and graffiti like juxtaposition.</p>
            
            <p>In 1995 she worked with her team from the pentagram to create advertising campaigns for a few of The Public Theatres productions. Throughout this Scher was mainly inspired by Rob Ray Kelly's American Wood Types and the theatre’s poster. She used silhouetted photographs and bright flat colours, as well as this she limited herself to 2 or 3 colours while she highlighted plays title and theatres logo. The main reason behind all off this was to appeal to a broad audience and especially those who have never been attracted the theatre. </p>
            
            <p>Between 1993-2005 Scher worked with The Public’s Producer, George C. Wolfe and Oskar Eustis, who was the art director in 2005. They worked together to develop a new distinct identity, which in the end was drawn from the Akzidenz Grotesk typeface. The previous logo had “theatre” along the bottom the vertical Public font, throughout the design process the word theatre was dropped and the word Public made more bold to give more emphasis. However more recently in 2008 the logo was recreated once again using a font called Knockout and turned horizontal. </p>

         <h2 id="shakespeare-in-the-park">Shakespeare in the Park</h2>
         
         <p>Since the early 1990s Scher provide all the identity work and design for promotion for The Public theatres long-running Shakespeare in New York central park series. She created the first poster campaign in 1994 of The Merry Wives of Windsor and Two Gentlemen of Verona. This created the groundwork of the new identity and visual language that came to establish the Public theatre. Because of this Scher’s Shakespeare in the Park campaigns became a repetitive traditional.</p>
         
         <p>The campaign for Hamlet and Hair in 2008 was inspired by the strict angles of a De Stiji-inspired grid which was a pattern seen in Manhattans streetscape.</p>
         
          <blockquote><p>“The Identity is like New York itself, constantly evolving”
            </p></blockquote>
         
         <p>For the Productions of The Winter's Tale and The Merchant of Venice in 2010 Scher designed and presented powerful production posters. The promotional campaign on this was focused on the evocative language in both the plays. She designed it in such a way that took lines from each production to allow the words and typography to meet in a expressive way.</p>
         
         <p>In 2011 Paula Scher was this campaign was awarded for Print Regional Design Annual 2011</p>

        <h2 id="maps">Maps</h2>
        
        <p>These maps were something Scher started in the 1990s. She began to create brightly coloured typographic maps ranging from the World to countries to oceans, and neighbourhoods. When Scher was a young designer she used to paint all her fonts by hand. </p>
        
        <p>In the Netflix documentary series: The Art of Design, Scher said that in the late 90s everything she did became completely computerized therefore she didn’t touch anything or use her hands. She talked about how in the past she cut things up, ripped things apart and that she touched art supplies. The physical lose was huge for her and therefore that is why she began the painting of the maps. Scher deliberately began painting the maps as they would take her a very long time to accomplish. Bringing her back to physically doing what she loved.</p>
        
          <blockquote><p>“I am not making design to answer questions but to raise them”</p></blockquote>
        
        <p>Schers maps showed the world or part of a country which was usually the US, which brought to life something very specific. Examples of these are global flight paths, zip codes used in the US postal system. ‘Paula Scher: MAPS’ is a book that was published which presents all 39 paintings, drawings, prints and environmental installations. Many of her paintings come to 12ft in height and the book reproduces the works in full and in life-size details that reveal layers of hand painted place names. Information and cultural commentary.</p>
